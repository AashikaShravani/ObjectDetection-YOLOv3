# ObjectDetection-YOLOv3
YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, version 3) is a real-time deep learning model for object detection. It divides an image into a grid, predicting bounding boxes and class labels for objects within each cell. Using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), it removes duplicate detections to output labelled boxes with confidence scores.
